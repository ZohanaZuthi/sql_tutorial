-- what is Window function in sql?
-- Window functions apply to aggregate and ranking functions over a particular window (set of rows). OVER clause is used with window functions to define that window. OVER clause does two things : 

-- Partitions rows to form a set of rows. (PARTITION BY clause is used) 
-- Orders rows within those partitions into a particular order. (ORDER BY clause is used) 
-- Note: If partitions arenâ€™t done, then ORDER BY orders all rows of the table. 
-- There are two kind of opertion in sql: group by and window function
